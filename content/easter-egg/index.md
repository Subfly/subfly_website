## ðŸŒ¸ You Found the Easter Egg!

Congratulations! You've discovered the hidden lotus flower (ðŸŒ¸) in the footer of this website. This isn't just a random emoji - it's a special tribute to someone very important in my life.

## The Story Behind the Lotus Flower

When my fiancÃ©e bought this domain for me, she created a simple website with just one image. It was her way of supporting my journey as a developer, even before I knew how to build websites myself.

## The Original Website

Here's the image from that very first website she made for me:

This image will always remain on this website as a reminder of where it all began - with love, support, and a simple gesture that meant the world to me.

## Why This Easter Egg?

I wanted to create something special that only the most observant visitors would find. The lotus flower in the footer is my way of saying "thank you" to her, hidden in plain sight for those who pay attention to the details.

So if you're reading this, you're one of the few who noticed the small details that make this website special. Thank you for taking the time to explore and discover this little piece of our story! ðŸŒ¸
